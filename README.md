There is a public css that contains all neccessary css style for the website . I use this because the bootstrap don't do as i want.
Specially i use for style the width and height of images , background image and table . And i use media query to style table and persons for the
resposibility.the bootstrap doesn't give a good positioning ,image width ,color  as i want which means to memic my figma  that is why i use public css .
